## How test it

1 - Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidSheltonSF/desafio-autoU.git
```

2 - Configure the .env file
```bash
BACKEND_HOST=0.0.0.0
BACKEND_PORT=8000
FRONTEND_PORT=5501
```
3 - In main.py file, modify the line bellow, calling load_from_hub_and_save() method,
so the AI model will be download from the hub and saved localy.
```python
classifier = ClassifierModel()
classifier.load_model_localy() # <- substitua esse mÃ©todo
```
4 - Run the command to build the docker container
```bash
